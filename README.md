Predicting whether a student will get placed based on some metrics using Machine Learning models which is mainly focused on Accuracy.


## Background:
With the increasing number of students graduating every year, there is a need to predict their chances of getting placed in a job. This can help both the students and the institutions prepare better for the job market. Machine learning models can be used to predict the placement probabilities of students based on their academic and non-academic performance.
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the placement probability of students based on their academic and non-academic performance. The model should be able to take in various inputs such as academic scores, work experience, etc. and output whether the student will get placed in a job.
## Methodology: 
#### The project will be implemented in the following steps:  
## Data Collection: 
Collect data from various sources such as college databases, online portals, and student surveys. The data should include various parameters such as academic scores, experiences, etc.  
## Data Pre-processing: 
Clean the data and remove any errors or missing values. Normalize the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.  
## Feature Engineering: 
Analyze the data and identify important features that affect the placement probability of students. Feature selection techniques can be used to reduce the number of features.  
## Model Selection: 
Select a suitable machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression, naive bayes, KNN and random forest. Train the model on the pre-processed data and optimize it to improve its accuracy.  
## Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve. Fine-tune the model to improve its performance.  
## Deployment: 
Deploy the model as a web application or API that can be used by students and institutions to predict placement probabilities.
## Tech Used:
Python, NumPy, Pandas

## Models Used:  
KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
